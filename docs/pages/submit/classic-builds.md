When turtle-v1 build is complete, user has to open the buildâ€™s page in a browser (e.g. by clicking the link in CLI) and copy the artifact URL (RMB on download buton -> copy link) -> paste the url to EAS Submit  either using --url or pasting when prompted.

basically just this but a bit longer and maybe with screenshots
