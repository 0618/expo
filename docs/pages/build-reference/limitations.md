title: Limitations
---

- credentials management / credentials.json supports a single target. eg: if you use an ios rich push notif, share extension, you'll need to work around that.
- limited caching features available for build speed
- limited customizability of software runtime environment
- managed expo project support is early and not recommended to rely on for production
- build timeout?
